<p>This project was designed for the Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) class in the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) program at White Plains High School during my sophomore year, 2013-2014. It is meant to showcase the skills that we learned in the course:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An understanding of the engineering design process</li>
  <li>Product research</li>
  <li>Time management</li>
  <li>Two dimensional and three dimensional analytical sketches</li>
  <li>CAD design</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Puzzle Design Challenge Brief</strong></p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong> Fine Office Furniture, Inc.</p>

<p><strong>Target Consumer:</strong> Ages 3+</p>

<p><strong>Designer:</strong> Max Kratzok</p>

<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A local office furniture manufacturing company throws away tens of thousands of scrap ¾” hardwood cubes that result from its furniture construction processes. The material is expensive, and the scrap represents a sizeable loss of profit.</p>

<p><strong>Design Statement:</strong> Fine Office Furniture, Inc. would like to return value to its waste product by using it as the raw material for desktop novelty items that will be sold on the showroom floor. Design, build, test, document, and present a three-dimensional puzzle system that is made from the scrap hardwood cubes. The puzzle system must provide an appropriate degree of challenge to a person who is three years of age or older.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The puzzle must be fabricated from 27 –  ¾”hardwood cubes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The puzzle system must contain exactly five puzzle pieces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each individual puzzle piece must consist of at least four, but no more than six hardwood cubes that are permanently attached to each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No two puzzle pieces can be the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The five puzzle pieces must assemble to form a 2 ¼” cube.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some puzzle parts should interlock.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When someone says “I used a design process to solve the problem at hand” that means that they had a problem to solve. They brainstormed different ways to solve the problem, for me that was the list of puzzle cube combinations that I could make. Then they looked for the best way to solve the problem with the ideas generated in the previous step, that was when I played with the different combinations and created a couple of cubes out of math blocks to see which was most difficult. Next, it’s time to document the ideas that I generated, that would be when I sketched out all of the pieces that I made and made the pieces on inventor. After that is assembly, putting the cube together, and finally, presentation, which is this website’s role.</p>

<p>My design meets every criterion of the design criteria. The puzzle is made of 27 –  ¾” hardwood cubes, contains exactly five puzzle which all consist of at least four, but no more than six hardwood cubes that are permanently attached to each other.
Also, no two puzzle pieces can be the same, the five puzzle pieces assemble to form a 2 ¼” cube and lastly, some puzzle parts interlock. My design definitely provides an appropriate degree of challenge to a person who is three years of age or older. I know this because, not only I am more than three years old but I am also the creator, and I still have trouble assembling it sometimes. Also, one of my peers took 10 minutes trying to solve it, and needed a hint and several more minutes to solve finish it.</p>

<p>If I could, I would make a 4x4x4 cube, which would be even more difficult.</p>
